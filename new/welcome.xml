		<body>Welcome and thanks for visiting Nick Birney's website. On this website, I have compiled some things about my life, for those individuals who may be interested. I have some selected works of poetry and prose that I have offered for your perusing pleasure. I will also soon be adding some work I've done, as a short online portfolio for interested parties. Until then, I bid you farewell.</body>
